Understanding Complexity: Demos and Simulations
-----------------------------------------------

These JavaScript programs are meant to accompany "Understanding
Complexity" from The Teaching Company, taught by Professor Scott
E. Page.

Lecture 3: The Interesting In-Between

greeting-game.html tests how many steps it takes to reach
equilibrium in a simple coordination game. In the trivial case of
1-connectedness, stasis is always reached in a single step. In the
case of complete connectedness, it may take considerably longer, but
eventually two options disappear leaving only the third. The
intermediate case is not yet implemented.

Lecture 4: Why Different Is More

simpson-index.html computes one diversity index of a population. After
generating a number of squares of different colors, the Simpson Index
shows the probability that two randomly square choices will be the
same color.
